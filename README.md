# AndfixDemo
This is a demo about Android Hotfix, compile with Ali's Andfix, version 0.4.1.

## Problem
Andfix new version 0.5.0 only support Android5.0\~7.0+, and Andfix old version 0.4.1 only support Android4.0\~6.0, so that is no friendly for total api version, and Andfix is no update anymore, but you can try the new one 'sophix', that is work for Hotfix too.
